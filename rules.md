**Welcome to the official The Sex Cauldron Community Discord**
A place to discuss The Sex Cauldron prank calls, other shows and join our Destiny 2 Clan. We hope you'll enjoy your stay here, but first off, we need you to read and abide by the rules listed below, which you will have to agree to before seeing any of the rest of the Discord. They're simple and easy to understand. If any of these bothers you, it may not be the place for you.

**1. Respect**  
    Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist or otherwise engage in hate speech. You can curse, but just don't be a jerk to others. This includes offensive memes. Just respect that everyone here is here for prank calls and fun.

**2. Be mature**  
    Please act mature in any discussions here. Don't spam, or clog general up with unnecessary messages. We don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly to spam rules.

**3. Be inclusive**  
    If someone asks you to stop discussing a sensitive topic, stop. We're trying to make this a friendly place. 

**4. Think before you type**  
    If you think a message might be grossly offensive to others, just don't send it. Any drama and slap fighting will be highlighted, and you will be pointed and laughed at. Possibly banned depending on severity. Don't push your luck.

**5. Keep stuff to the correct channels**  
    For example, keep memes to #imageboard. It's fine if you post something better fitting to another channel to #chatboard . Keep #âš•-mental-health-alliance for serious discussion, and treat it as such. We at the Sex Cauldron want to remove the stigma from mental illness and help people to not feel so alone or helpless in this post-COVID world.

**6. Follow Discord TOS**  
    Every member here needs to follow the Discord Terms of Service, for example, their age requirement. You are not exempt from this because you've been around for a while or contribute financially. Needs of the many and all that. (<https://discord.com/terms>)

**7. NSFW Content**  
    Keep Not Safe For Work content out of this guild. There may be underage people here, and plus, there's enough places out there already.

**8. Patreon Content**  
    We don't allow Patreon pay-walled content to be posted in this guild in any form and will ban you on sight and inform the creator, don't be a dick. 

**9. Self-promotion**  
    Don't advertise your own content here without prior authorisation. This includes streams, YT channels and Discord guild invites. This rule may not be enforced if the content is relevant to the discussion. If you're an up-and-coming host or artist or whatever, just talk to @SagaciousZu#5137 first. That's all we ask.

**10. Drama**  
    Don't bring drama from other communities here. Expect a ban. We're not your personal army.

**12. Impersonation**  
    Impersonating people, including a janitor/moderator/robot/admin of The Sex Cauldron, is not allowed. Instant, non-revocable ban.

**Punishment Guidance**
    Generally, we operate on a 3-strikes-you're-out system, starting with a warning, mute (length to mod discretion), finally a temporary/permanent ban. However, this guidance might be broken according to the acting moderator. For example, if you clearly are joining just to troll, or are posting slurs/NSFW content, we may ban you on the spot, or, in the case of minimal rule breakage, we may give a non-strike verbal warning.

**Credits**  
These rules have been based very heavily on Dankpod's Discord server rules <https://github.com/lexd0g/dankcord-stuff> which were derived from /r/iPod's rules, written by @fnuer#1956 and discord.gg/ipod, which have been based off the GNU/FSF IRC rules <https://www.gnu.org/server/irc-rules.en.html>

**Disclaimer**  
By sending a message, changing your nickname, or otherwise interacting in this guild, you consent to this. If you want a logged action deleted or more details please contact a member of @House Staff
